== Introduction

The Google Calendar Editor application is used for monitoring Google calendars and updating events to change the description text at a specified time before the start of the event.
The current use case is for YMCAs to update their events for exercise classes to add text indicating the event is open for registration.
This is detected by the app used by patrons and allows the patrons to register to attend the class.

== Running the service

Google Calendar Editor is written using https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot[Spring Boot] which makes it easy to get it up and running so that you can start exploring the REST API.

The first step is to clone the Git repository:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/kassiebowman/google-calendar-editor
----

Once the clone is complete, you're ready to get the service up and running:

[source,bash]
----
$ gradlew clean build
$ java -jar build\libs\google-calendar-editor-0.0.2-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

Note: you can also use `gradlew bootRun` instead of `java -jar`, but if you do so, you will not be able to access the generated version of these docs that is served by the web server.

You can check that the service is up and running by executing a simple request using cURL:

include::{snippets}/getConfiguration/curl-request.adoc[]

This request should yield the following response in the
https://github.com/mikekelly/hal_specification[Hypertext Application Language (HAL)]
format:

include::{snippets}/getConfiguration/http-response.adoc[]

To view the generated version of these docs that is served by the web server, navigate to:

// Below is an example from https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-restdocs/blob/e2e61dff53387d813c2fecb5fa583bc63d0d525c/samples/rest-notes-spring-data-rest/src/main/asciidoc/getting-started-guide.adoc

//== Creating a note
//Now that you've started the service and verified that it works, the next step is to use
//it to create a new note. As you saw above, the URI for working with notes is included as
//a link when you perform a `GET` request against the root of the service:
//
//include::{snippets}/index/1/http-response.adoc[]
//
//To create a note, you need to execute a `POST` request to this URI including a JSON
//payload containing the title and body of the note:
//
//include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/1/curl-request.adoc[]
//
//The response from this request should have a status code of `201 Created` and contain a
//`Location` header whose value is the URI of the newly created note:
//
//include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/1/http-response.adoc[]
//
//To work with the newly created note you use the URI in the `Location` header. For example,
//you can access the note's details by performing a `GET` request:
//
//include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/2/curl-request.adoc[]
//
//This request will produce a response with the note's details in its body:
//
//include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/2/http-response.adoc[]
//
//Note the `tags` link which we'll make use of later.
//
//
//== Creating a tag
//To make a note easier to find, it can be associated with any number of tags. To be able
//to tag a note, you must first create the tag.
//
//Referring back to the response for the service's index, the URI for working with tags is
//include as a link:
//
//include::{snippets}/index/1/http-response.adoc[]
//
//To create a tag you need to execute a `POST` request to this URI, including a JSON
//payload containing the name of the tag:
//
//include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/3/curl-request.adoc[]
//
//The response from this request should have a status code of `201 Created` and contain a
//`Location` header whose value is the URI of the newly created tag:
//
//include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/3/http-response.adoc[]
//
//To work with the newly created tag you use the URI in the `Location` header. For example
//you can access the tag's details by performing a `GET` request:
//
//include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/4/curl-request.adoc[]
//
//This request will produce a response with the tag's details in its body:
//
//include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/4/http-response.adoc[]
//
//
//== Tagging a note
//A tag isn't particularly useful until it's been associated with one or more notes. There
//are two ways to tag a note: when the note is first created or by updating an existing
//note. We'll look at both of these in turn.
//
//
//=== Creating a tagged note
//The process is largely the same as we saw before, but this time, in addition to providing
//a title and body for the note, we'll also provide the tag that we want to be associated
//with it.
//
//Once again we execute a `POST` request. However, this time, in an array named tags, we
//include the URI of the tag we just created:
//
//include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/5/curl-request.adoc[]
//
//Once again, the response's `Location` header tells us the URI of the newly created note:
//
//include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/5/http-response.adoc[]
//
//As before, a `GET` request executed against this URI will retrieve the note's details:
//
//include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/6/curl-request.adoc[]
//include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/6/http-response.adoc[]
//
//To verify that the tag has been associated with the note, we can perform a `GET` request
//against the URI from the `tags` link:
//
//include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/7/curl-request.adoc[]
//
//The response embeds information about the tag that we've just associated with the note:
//
//include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/7/http-response.adoc[]
//
//
//=== Tagging an existing note
//An existing note can be tagged by executing a `PATCH` request against the note's URI with
//a body that contains the array of tags to be associated with the note. We'll used the
//URI of the untagged note that we created earlier:
//
//include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/8/curl-request.adoc[]
//
//This request should produce a `204 No Content` response:
//
//include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/8/http-response.adoc[]
//
//When we first created this note, we noted the tags link included in its details:
//
//include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/2/http-response.adoc[]
//
//We can use that link now and execute a `GET` request to see that the note now has a
//single tag:
//
//include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/9/curl-request.adoc[]
//include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/9/http-response.adoc[]
